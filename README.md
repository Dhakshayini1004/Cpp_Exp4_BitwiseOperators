## Theory
### What are Bitwise Operators?
- Bitwise operators perform operations directly on binary bits of integers.
- Each bit is either 0 or 1, and these operators let us manipulate bits individually, unlike arithmetic or logical operators which operate on entire values.

- They are commonly used in:
- Embedded systems and microcontrollers
- Cryptography
- Digital logic simulation
- Memory-efficient coding (e.g., flags and masks)
  
| Operator    | Symbol | Description                                     |
|-------------|--------|-------------------------------------------------|
| AND         | `&`    | Sets bit to 1 only if both bits are 1           |
| OR          | `\|`   | Sets bit to 1 if at least one bit is 1          |
| XOR         | `^`    | Sets bit to 1 if only one of the bits is 1      |
| NOT         | `~`    | Inverts all bits (0 becomes 1, 1 becomes 0)     |
| Left Shift  | `<<`   | Shifts bits to the left, multiplying by 2       |
| Right Shift | `>>`   | Shifts bits to the right, dividing by 2         |


### Why Do We Need Bitwise Operators in C++

- **Efficient Performance**
  - Bitwise operations are faster than arithmetic or logical operations.
  - Used in scenarios where speed and optimization are critical (e.g., game engines, drivers).

- **Memory Efficiency**
  - Helps compact multiple boolean values into a single byte or word using bit fields.
  - Ideal for embedded systems where memory is limited.

- **Low-Level Hardware Control**
  - Essential for working with microcontrollers, registers, and hardware interfaces.
  - Bitwise manipulation is required to set, clear, or toggle specific hardware bits.

- **Flags and Masking**
  - Allows checking, setting, and toggling of specific flags using bit masking techniques.
  - Common in situations where multiple options are encoded in a single integer (like status registers).

- **Encryption and Compression**
  - Widely used in cryptographic algorithms, compression utilities, and checksums.
  - Operates on bits directly for fine-grained control.

- **Data Serialization**
  - Helps convert structured data into compact bit-level formats for transmission or storage.

- **Graphics and Image Processing**
  - Used for operations like color manipulation, alpha blending, and pixel-level control.

- **Permission Handling**
  - Used to encode and check user or file permissions efficiently using bit patterns.

- **Avoiding Division and Multiplication**
  - Shift operators (`<<` and `>>`) can be used in place of multiplication or division by powers of two.

###  Set and Reset a Bit
- In many applications, especially in embedded systems, hardware control, and memory optimization, we often need to change only one specific bit in a number â€” not the whole number.

- This is useful for:
-- Turning on/off a feature (flags)
-- Controlling specific hardware bits (like LEDs, relays, sensors)
-- Performing fast and memory-efficient operations

- Setting a bit means changing a specific bit to 1, regardless of its current value.
- `1 <<` pos shifts 1 to the left by pos bits, creating a mask.
- Bitwise OR `|` ensures the bit at that position becomes 1.
- Other bits remain unchanged.

- Resetting a bit means changing a specific bit to 0, regardless of its current value.
- 1 << pos creates a mask with 1 at the desired position.
- `~` inverts the mask to have 0 at the bit we want to reset.
- Bitwise AND & turns that bit to 0, leaving other bits unchanged.

## Program Description

### âœ… Part 1: Syntax
- We define 2 numbers and perform bitwise operations on them.
- `AND` returns 1 only when both the bit inputs are 1.
- `Right Shift` shifts all the 1s towards right side, basically divides the number by 2.
- `Left Shift` shifts all the 1s towards left side, basically multiplies the number by 2.
- `XOR` returns one only when the bit inputs are not equal to each other.
- `NOT` returns the Two's complement of the entered number.
- `OR` returns 1 even if any of the bit input is 1.
- However, the output of the program is decimal.
  
### âœ… Part 2: Logic
 - Set specific bits -  num | (1 << bit_position)
 - Reset specific bits - num & (~(1 << bit_position))
