# C++ Experiment 4: To study and implement C++ Bitwise Operators

## Aim

To:
1. To do basic bitwise operators.
2. To set and reset specific bits of given number

---

## Objectives

-To use if, if else and else to make a program that decides 
(i) Whether an user entered number is positive or negative.
(ii) the grade of a student.
(iii) Whether the entered coordinate is in I/II/III/IV quadrant.
- To use relational operators like >,<,>=,<= to describe boundary conditions.
- TO use logical operators like &&,|,==.
---

## Program Description

### âœ… Part 1: Syntax
- We define variables to hold the user-input values(`chem,math,phy,c_prog,pyth,percentage`,`x,y`).
- The scope of each condition of if, if else ans else are given by `{}`.
- THe condition is given under `()`.
### âœ… Part 2: If-Else Statements
 - If else statements work on the basis of true or false, true is 1 and false is 0.
 - A condition is written under if, if the condition is true, 1 is returned and code under if statement is executed. However if 0 is returned(false), the code under else part is executed.

## Concepts Used

- If-else statements
- Relational operators(`>=`,`<=`,`>`,`<`)
- Logical operators(`&&`,`|`,`==`)

Enter the position of bit to be set: 
4
Enter a number to be reset: 
44
Enter the position of bit to be reset: 
5
Set number: 49
Reset number: 12
```
